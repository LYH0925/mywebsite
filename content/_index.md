Welcome to my homepage! My name is Yuhang Liu. I am now a senior undergraduate student majoring in journalism at Zhejiang Gongshang University, advised by Prof. Zheng Liu. I’m really into interdisciplinary knowledge, open-source tech, and exploring human group behavior. Currently, I’ve been exploring computational social Science and AIGC-related fields.
